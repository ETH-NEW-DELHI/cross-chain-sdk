# Osmosis Integration for Cross-Chain SDK

## Overview

This document outlines the integration of Osmosis blockchain support into the Cross-Chain SDK, enabling seamless cross-chain operations between Osmosis and other supported networks.

## Osmosis Network Specifications

- **Chain ID**: `osmosis-1`
- **Network Type**: Cosmos SDK-based blockchain
- **Native Token**: OSMO
- **RPC Endpoints**: 
  - Mainnet: `https://rpc.osmosis.zone`
  - Testnet: `https://rpc-test.osmosis.zone`
- **Address Format**: Bech32 (e.g., `osmo1...`)

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Chain Type Extension

Osmosis will be integrated as a new chain type (`COSMOS`) alongside existing EVM and SVM support:

```typescript
export enum ChainType {
    EVM,
    SVM,
    COSMOS  // New addition for Osmosis
}
```

### 2. Address Handling

Osmosis uses Bech32 address format, requiring:
- Custom address validation
- Conversion utilities between Bech32 and other formats
- Integration with existing `AddressLike` interface

### 3. Contract Integration

Osmosis smart contracts (CosmWasm) will be supported through:
- Custom contract factory for CosmWasm contracts
- Integration with existing escrow factory patterns
- Cross-chain message passing via IBC

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Add Osmosis to supported chains enum
- [ ] Implement Cosmos chain type detection
- [ ] Create Osmosis address handling utilities
- [ ] Add basic network configuration

### Phase 2: Contract Support
- [ ] Implement CosmWasm contract factory
- [ ] Create Osmosis-specific escrow contracts
- [ ] Add IBC message handling
- [ ] Integrate with existing order system

### Phase 3: Cross-Chain Operations
- [ ] Implement Osmosis ↔ EVM cross-chain orders
- [ ] Implement Osmosis ↔ Solana cross-chain orders
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Update documentation and examples

## Technical Considerations

### IBC Integration
Osmosis uses Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) for cross-chain operations:
- IBC packet handling for cross-chain messages
- Custom timeout and retry mechanisms
- Integration with existing relayer infrastructure

### CosmWasm Contracts
Smart contracts on Osmosis are CosmWasm-based:
- Different ABI format compared to EVM
- Custom instruction encoding/decoding
- Integration with existing contract interfaces

### Gas and Fees
Osmosis uses a different fee model:
- Native OSMO for transaction fees
- Custom gas estimation logic
- Integration with existing fee handling

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Address validation and conversion
- Contract interaction utilities
- Cross-chain message encoding/decoding

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end cross-chain operations
- IBC packet handling
- Error scenarios and edge cases

### Test Networks
- Osmosis testnet integration
- Cross-chain test scenarios
- Performance benchmarking

## Documentation Updates

### API Documentation
- Osmosis-specific API endpoints
- Cross-chain operation examples
- Error handling and troubleshooting

### Developer Guides
- Getting started with Osmosis integration
- Best practices for cross-chain operations
- Migration guide from existing chains

## Security Considerations

### Address Validation
- Strict Bech32 address validation
- Protection against address format attacks
- Cross-chain address verification

### Contract Security
- CosmWasm contract audit considerations
- IBC packet validation
- Cross-chain message integrity

## Performance Optimization

### Connection Pooling
- Efficient RPC connection management
- Custom retry mechanisms for IBC operations
- Optimized gas estimation

### Caching
- Address format caching
- Contract ABI caching
- Cross-chain state caching

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- Osmosis-specific DeFi integrations
- Advanced IBC routing
- Custom fee optimization

### Ecosystem Integration
- Osmosis DEX integration
- LP token support
- Advanced trading features

## Contributing

When contributing to the Osmosis integration:

1. Follow existing code patterns and conventions
2. Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation for any API changes
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing chains
5. Follow the established commit message format
